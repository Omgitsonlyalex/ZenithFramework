# Zenith

### What is Zenith?

Zenith is an email framework made easy using SASS.


### Usage

#### Compass
To get started, you'll need SASS and Compass.

Install compass:
```
$ gem update --system
$ gem install compass
```

If you need more information about compass installation, please refer to its [documentation](http://compass-style.org/install/).

#### Inlining

To inline, I'm using [premailer](https://github.com/premailer/premailer/).

Once you have it installed, you just need to run the .rb ruby file I've set up by putting the following into your terminal/command line application
```
$ ruby config.rb
```

This takes your ```email.html``` from your templates folder and saves it into ```email.html``` in your inlined folder.
